# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Firebase configuration

This app uses the Firebase Web SDK (Auth, Firestore, Storage). Provide your Web app config via environment variables.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill values from Firebase Console → Project Settings → Your apps → Web (</>) → Config.
2. Ensure `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` ends with `appspot.com` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID` contains `:web:`.
3. Restart Expo to load env:

```bash
npx expo start -c
```

Note: `.env` is gitignored; commit `.env.example`.

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
